          <h2>Start by joining a room</h2>
          <p>
            A room is a collection of users among which you want to send/receive
            files. Rooms in Blaze can be thought of as group chats in messaging
            apps. Each user in a room must have a unique name for them to
            correctly join the room.
          </p>
          <p>
            All your previously joined rooms show up in
            <a href="/app/"> Recent Rooms </a>
            page for quick access in the future. These rooms itself are not
            persisted on any database and are immediately destroyed once all the
            users of that room leave.
          </p>

            Send a file!

          </h2>
          <p>
            Sending a file is easy in Blaze. Just click on the 'Send File'
            button at the bottom right and choose the files that you want to
            send. Once the files are selected, they would be shared with all the
            other users in that room.
          </p>
          <p>
            Blaze uses
            <a href="http://webtorrent.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
              {' '}
              WebTorrent{' '}
            </a>
            or WebSockets for sharing files depending on the WebRTC support of
            the browsers being used.
            <a href="https://webrtc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
              {' '}
              WebRTC{' '}
            </a>
            is the protocol that makes it possible for the peer-to-peer
            connection for file transfer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Do note that if the sender of a file leaves the room and the file
            isn't transferred to any user yet, the file transfer would get
            cancelled resulting in no-one receiving the file. This is because
            your files are not stored on any server and are transferred in
            real-time when you are online.

            If you enjoyed using Blaze, you can add Blaze to your home screen!
            Doing this not only makes Blaze easy to access but it also shows up
            in the share tray when you are sharing a file from other apps using{' '}
